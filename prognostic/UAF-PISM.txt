Ice sheet initial conditions are provided by the “calibrated” experiments in Aschwanden, Fahnestock, and Truffer (2016). To goal of an initialization procedure is to provide a present-day energy state which can currently not be obtained from observations alone. To define the energy state, a “standard” glacial cycle run was performed where the surface can evolve freely, similar to Aschwanden et al. (2013). The spin-up started at 125 kyr BP with the present-day topography from Howat, Negrete, and Smith (2014) using a horizontal grid resolution of 9 km. The grid was refined to 6 km, 4.5 km, and 3 km at 25 kyr BP, 20 kyr BP and 15 kyr BP, respectively. We used a positive degree-day scheme to compute the climatic mass balance from surface temperature (Fausto et al., 2009) and model-constrained precipitation (Ettema et al., 2009). The degree-day factors were the same as in Huybrechts (1999). Second, we accounted for paleo-climatic variations by applying a scalar anomaly term derived from the GRIP ice core oxygen isotope record (Dansgaard et al., 1993) to the temperature field (Huybrechts, 2002). Then we adjusted mean annual precipitation in proportion to the mean annual air temperature change (Huybrechts, 2002). Finally, sea level forcing, which determines the land area available for glaciation, is derived from the SPECMAP marine δ18O record (Imbrie et al., 1992). Using this as a starting point, we then ran a 100-year long relaxation simulation at 900 m resolution to account for differences/updates in model physics, but we kept the ice surface close to observations using a flux correction (Aschwanden, Fahnestock, and Truffer, 2016). The result is an initial state that is both close to the observed geometry (Howat, Negrete, and Smith, 2014) and surface speeds (Rignot and Mouginot, 2012) of 2008. For ISMIP6, the initial state was regridded to a horizontal resolution of 1 km as defined by ISMIP.
